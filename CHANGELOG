Changes in version 0.1a2 - xx.xx.2008

  Major improvements:    
    o Making use of locales (until now only de-DE and en-US is supported)
    o Compatibility to Firefox 2 by providing different versions of the file
      netError.xhtml and defining 'appversion' in chrome.manifest
  
  Minor improvements:
    o Catching an uncaught exception that was thrown on 'view source code'
    o Removed 'contents.rdf' files since these are needed for backwards
      compatibility (to Firefox < 1.5) only
