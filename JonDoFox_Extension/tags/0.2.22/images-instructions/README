The directory 'screenshots-bmp' contains the original screenshots. These are 
best edited using the Gimp, stored as .png, and imported in Inkscape 
afterwards. Inkscape can then be used to add text and arrows etc. To export
pngs from Inkscape, it is important to deactivate oversampling of bitmaps in 
the general Inkscape settings panel.
