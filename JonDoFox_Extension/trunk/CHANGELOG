  New Feature:

      feature page

      better detection of MITM attacks
    * the search history is now deleted after every 5 minutes

      via about:config

    * show the JonDoFox download page if the user should update the profile and
      has not disabled the update warning
    * improved referrer logic: if 3rd party content is loaded the referrer is 
      not modified
    * "extensions.jondofox.security.default_personal_cert" is set to 
      "Ask Every Time" and makes thus sure that user certificates are not
      sent automatically to the server
    * "extensions.jondofox.security.remember_cert_checkbox_default_setting"

      a user certificate automatically during a session if she just clicks
      through the dialog once

  Minor Improvement:
    * show only second-level domains in the NoScript menu (once a new version of
      the JonDoFox extension is found "extensions.jondofox.noscript_showDomain"
      is checked and if it is set to "false" only the second-level domains are
      shown)

    * included SafeCache's functionality
    * show anontest page on startup if no (proper) proxy is configured
    * there is now a new preference, extensions.jondofox.alwaysUseJonDo, which,
      if set to true, ignores the proxy used in the last session and lets the 
      browser start always with JonDo; default is "false"
    * added a special overlay which is shown to the user if she wants to
      download a .doc or a .rtf file: OpenOffice.org shall be used for
      security's sake

      selected after the Save-button and the checkbox have been selected

Changes in verison 0.2.3 - 2009-11-10

  New Feature:
    * Minimized the need for updating the whole profile if there are
      changes in the extension
    * included several new warnings which may be disabled by the user:
      -update warnings (if the user has to update/enable the profile or some 
       other extensions (NoScript, SafeCache))
      -preference warnings (in case the user modifies the recommended prefs and
       thus is not surfing securely anymore)
      -proxy warnings (if the user is not using a proper configured proxy or 
       no proxy at all for her surfing)
    * 'Benutzerdefiniert' or 'Custom Proxy' is now shown in red letters as well
       if there is, despite its appearance, no properly configured proxy in use
    * The user may change the UA if she configures a custom proxy (not faked,
      the Tor-UA, JonDo-UA). If there is no proxy in use, the unfaked UA is sent
      if Tor the Tor one and if JonDo the JonDo UA
    * Improvement of the downlaod of files without using a proxy (via the 
      context menu). Now the user can be redirected to an other location and 
      the download is not done using the Mix-cascades.
    * Warnings if the downloads files which may be opened by external apps
    * Prohibiting the option of opening files automatically with an external app
    * Improved the Custom Proxy dialog. It works now like the proxy settings
      panel in Firefox (remembering old values if the box 'Use settings
      for all protocols' is checked...)
    * If there is no appropriate Custom Proxy set but nevertheless used
      it is not possible to download files via the context menu: 
      the bypassing proxy option is deactivated

  Location Neutrality:
    * Preference for setting 'accept charsets' to 
      'text/html,application/xml,*/*'; this was necessary due to some yahoo
      pages which do not work with '*/*' anymore 

  Minor improvements:
    * Copied a icon in the root directory of the extension (icon.png) thus the
      JonDoFox icon is still shown even if the extension is disabled (Feature of
      Firefox 3.6)
    * modified a misleading log message in jondofox-gui.js

Changes in version 0.2.0 - 2009-05-xx:

      netError.xhtml and defining 'appversion' in chrome.manifest
