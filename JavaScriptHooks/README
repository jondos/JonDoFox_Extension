There are currently three kinds of tests in the test directory:

1) It is tested whether the Tor Browser is starting with a dimension which is a
muliple of 200/100 (testBrowserDimensionsStartup.js)
1) Tests examining whether the fake values are applied at all (these include the
  files testScreenHooks* and testWindowHooks*)
2) Tests that try to find leaks (these are all the other test files)

The tests reflect

https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/refs/heads/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/firefox/0023-Do-not-expose-physical-screen-info.-via-window-and-w.patch
